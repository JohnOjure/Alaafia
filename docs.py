When an infected mosquito bites a person, the parasites are injected into their bloodstream. These parasites then travel to the liver, mature, and multiply. After a period, they leave the liver and infect red blood cells, leading to the symptoms of malaria. If left untreated, malaria can be fatal, especially for vulnerable groups."

        "content": "Community engagement and effective health education are vital for the success of malaria control programs in Nigeria. This involves raising awareness about malaria transmission, symptoms, prevention methods (like ITN use and environmental hygiene), and the importance of prompt testing and adherence to treatment. Community health workers (CHWs) play a crucial role in delivering health messages, distributing ITNs, and facilitating access to diagnostics and treatment at the grassroots level. Overcoming misconceptions and promoting positive health-seeking behaviors within communities is essential for sustained impact on malaria burden."
